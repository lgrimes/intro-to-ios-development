# App Development with Swift üì±

When you start to learn a programming language, it can be very daunting. Where do you start? Is the language you are learning the best one? These are all common questions that every programmer has asked themselves at some stage. Luckily, learning Swift as your first language makes it a bit easier. Swift is easy to read and the syntax can be easliy understood without knowing too much about programming. The first language you learn will definitely not be the last, so think of this as your stepping stone.
